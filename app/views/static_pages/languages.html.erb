					<p><strong>Says one private client</strong>,</p> <blockquote><p>&ldquo;<em>Having spent nearly thirty years in Austria, Hillary has the skills of a native speaker, but the patience to sympathize with the challenges of learning German as a second language. Her enthusiasm for German literature and culture make it especially fun to engage with the language â€¦ With Hillary's guidance, I feel like I've been able to improve my German skills significantly within just a few months. I've also been able to find an apartment in Berlin thanks to Hillary's help with communicating with lessors in German. I would recommend her to anybody learning German, whether they are learning for work or just for fun.&rdquo; &mdash; Frances Provine</em></p></blockquote>
