			<p class="poem">fog and my book, outside<br>
			morning frost on grass blades,<br>
			berries, brambles—the morning<br>
			walk of gaze, through window the<br>
			earth is redeveloped, a kind of plaster<br>
			doesn’t  prefer me; though pie and sex,<br> 
			slices of love laid open in my space and<br>
			eyes, a view I fill, a curved wall of beauty<br>
			with purple bag and fur, a style of diagonal<br>
			on brown soft, the vessel of concept, this<br>
			fierceness is anti-fragile and expansive,<br>
			lets in evening light.</p>
